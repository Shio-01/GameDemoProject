# GameDemoProject
This demo is just a display of my initial Unreal Engine 5 skills. This isn't supposed to become a proper game. It's supposed to be just a sandbox for me to learn more about UE5 and game development as a whole.

Currently in the game I've included:
- Custom movement system
- Unarmed attacks
- Katana attacks
  - 3 attack combo attack system and secondary attack
- Rock weapon with a range attack
- Wave spawns with customizable numbers inside code
- Zombie type enemies
- Health and stamina systems with UI elements
- Countdown between waves, current wave and enemies left on the UI
- Very basic map using UE store assets
- Customizable item blueprint with a pick up function

I'm planning to add:
- a crossbow with a proper aiming system and UI elements
- vaulting over objects
- drinking and getting drunk
- enemy variants
- more
